# joy

Joy is a GitOps CLI tool with Kubernetes-style YAML file formats for simplifying the deployment of project releases to Kubernetes and their promotion across environments. It proves a perfect complement to other GitOps tools, such as [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/) and [Crossplane](https://www.crossplane.io/).

- Defines Kubernetes-style YAML file formats:
  - `Environment`: A Kubernetes cluster and/or namespace to deploy to.
  - `Project`: An application (eg: a microservice, front-end...) that can be deployed to different environments.
  - `Release`: The deployment configuration for a specific version of a project to a given environment.
- GitOps-oriented: Your joy "catalog" git repo defines the Source of Truthâ„¢ for your environments, projects and releases. Combined with the ApplicationSet generator plugin, changes to releases are detected by ArgoCD, transformed and deployed to the target environment.
- The `joy` CLI allows you to:
  - List and select environments, projects, releases.
  - Promote releases from one environment to another, transfering specific portions of release configuration intelligently.
  - Query who owns given projects/releases, optionally integrating with [jac](https://github.com/nestoca/jac) for rich people metadata.
- The [joy-generator](https://github.com/nestoca/joy-generator) ArgoCD `ApplicationSet` generator plugin allows to automatically generate ArgoCD `Application` resources from your joy catalog, to deploy your releases to Kubernetes.
- YAML resources are extensible via custom values to address your specific metadata needs.

# Why joy?

Joy dramatically reduces the cognitive load on developers when it comes to deploying their projects to Kubernetes. It allows them to think in terms of high-level release YAML files, and then to use the `joy` CLI to promote those releases across environments.

It also provides the DevOps/platform engineers with a layer of abstraction to manage the more intricate deployment details, such as ArgoCD Applications and Helm charts.

What makes joy releases useful and powerful:
- They only contain the high-level information that is relevant to developers, providing a very simple, visual and intuitive interface to the deployment process.
- Portions of the release that are environment-specific can be locked with a special `# lock` comment to prevent them from being carried over from environment to environment during promotions.
- They tie together all the deployment configuration that needs to travel with a given build, such as:
  - Container image+version
  - Helm chart+version
  - Helm values for deploying the container

# Installing joy

## Installing with homebrew

```bash
$ brew tap nestoca/public
$ brew install joy
```

Upgrade with:
```
$ brew update
$ brew upgrade joy
```

## Installing manually

Download from GitHub [releases](https://github.com/nestoca/joy/releases/latest) and put the binary somewhere in your $PATH.

## Cloning your catalog repo

```
$ git clone git@github.com:<OWNER>/<CATALOG>.git ~/.joy
```

That is the default location where joy will look for your catalog repo. If you want to clone your catalog in a different location for convenience, create a `~/.joy/config.yaml` file with the following content to redirect joy to it:

```yaml
catalog-dir: /absolute/path/to/your/catalog
```

# How does it work?

- DevOps/platform engineers create a "joy catalog" git repo, defining different `Environment` resources.
- Developers create `Project` and `Release` resources in that same git repo.
- `Release` resources placed within same sub-directory tree as an `Environment` resource are considered part of that environment.
- A `Release` defines:
  - The release's name.
  - The project it belongs to.
  - The version of the container to deploy.
  - The Helm chart to use for deployment.
  - The values to pass to the Helm chart.
  - Certain environment-specific portions of the release can be marked with a `# lock` comment to exclude them from promotions.
- CI pipelines for `master` branch build call `joy build promote` at the end of their process to promote the release in

# Using joy with jac

[Jac](https://github.com/nestoca/jac) is a GitOps CLI tool and YAML file format for managing and querying your people metadata Source of Truthâ„¢.

In order to use jac with joy, simply configure your joy projects with owners that correspond to jac group identifiers, for example:

```yaml
apiVersion: joy.nesto.ca/v1alpha1
kind: Project
metadata:
  name: podinfo
spec:
  owners:
    - team-dragons
```

You can then use `joy project people` and `joy release people` to have jac resolve the actual people owning those projects and releases:

```bash
$ joy release people
Select release:
  service-1
  service-2
> podinfo-1
  podinfo-2

  NAME          FIRST NAME  LAST NAME  EMAIL              GROUPS                      INHERITED GROUPS
  jack-sparrow  Jack        Sparrow    jack@example.com   DevOps Dragons              TechÂ Support
  peter-pan     Peter       Pan        peter@example.com  BackendÂ Developer Dragons   TechÂ Support
 â€”â€”â€”
 Count: 2
```

Arbitrary arguments and flags following those two commands will be passed directly to jac, allowing you to leverage all of jac's querying and filtering capabilities.

Note that the `jac` CLI must be installed and configured on your machine in order for this to work.

# Using joy with Sealed Secrets

[Sealed Secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets) is an open-source Kubernetes controller and client-side CLI tool from Bitnami that aims to solve the problem of storing secrets in Git using asymmetric crypto encryption. It generates a public and private key and can be used to encrypt/decrypt application secrets in a secure way. Sealed Secrets are "one-way" encrypted K8s Secrets that can be created by anyone but can only be decrypted by the controller running in the target cluster recovering the original object.

## Importing sealed secrets certificates into your joy catalog

Joy takes advantage of the fact that the public key (or "certificate") for each cluster â€” required by developers to encrypt secrets â€” is not sensitive and can safely be stored in your joy git catalog in each `Environment` resource, for example:

```yaml
apiVersion: joy.nesto.ca/v1alpha1
kind: Environment
metadata:
  name: staging
spec:
  order: 0
  owners:
    - team-dragons
  sealedSecretsCert: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    MIIEaDCCZrSgZwIBZgIQQVigtDuTUYj4m2BxtpZbPaZNBgkqhkiG9w0BZQsFZDZZ
    MB4XDTIyMTZwNaIwNTZyN1oXDTMyMTZwNDIwNTZyN1owZDCCZiIwDQYJKoZIhvcN
...
    kwqbLB/f7nqjUZvN6fkjqKCleLx4GI3H8WZxURqYU2ZPQ6/6kmNZHjekiYRJYhdn
    QpgDdtXavNV/KcrL1je/BZErRusBbjR5LwFaZp0YCo0=
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

Joy provides a command to help you automatically extract your cluster's public key and add it to one of your `Environment` resources, assuming you have proper permissions to read secrets from given cluster:

```bash
$ joy sealed-secrets import

? Select kube context of cluster to fetch seal secrets certificate from:
  dev-rw
  dev-admin
  staging-rw
> staging-admin
  production-rw
  production-admin

? Select environment to import sealed secrets certificate into:
  dev
> staging
  production

âœ… Imported sealed secrets certificate from cluster staging-admin into environment staging
Make sure to commit and push those changes to git.
```

## Encrypting secrets

Once the sealed secrets certificate has been imported and committed into your joy catalog, developers can use the `joy sealed-secrets seal` command to encrypt their secrets for a specific environment:

```bash
$ joy sealed-secrets seal

? Select environment to seal secret in:
  dev
> staging
  production

? Enter secret to seal [Enter 2 empty lines to finish]
This is my highly
sensitive secret
which comprises
multiple lines

```

Note that the `kubeseal` CLI must be installed on your machine in order for this to work.

# Combining deployments and infrastructure provisioning

Integrating a tool like [Crossplane](https://www.crossplane.io/) with joy allows you to provision the infrastructure required by your projects as part of the same release process as their deployment. This is a powerful way to ensure that your infrastructure is always in sync with your project deployments.

Take the example of a project that's just been modified to now require a storage bucket. Whenever that new version will be deployed to a new environment, it will require that bucket to be provisioned in that environment. With joy, that infrastructure requirement can be defined in the `Release` resource values and that bucket can be provisioned automatically whenever that new version of the project gets promoted to a new environment. That is a game changer, as it can be extremely tricky to try and keep track of the evolving infrastructure requirements of your projects as they get promoted across environments.

As Crossplane is not yet very flexible in terms of templating (eg: conditionals and loops), we recommend relying on helm charts to deal with this templating complexity and create the appropriate Crossplane resources required by the project based on the values passed to it. For example, given a `bucketName` value, the helm chart could create a Crossplane `Bucket` resource and let the Crossplane provider provision the actual bucket in the cloud.
